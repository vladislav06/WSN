// PD5: Receiver.
// Receives the packets sent from the transmitter and counts the expected packet count:
// Usually, the transmitter sends 10 packets per second.
// If we manage to receive 10, then it's working great!
// If not, then we are most likely losing some packets.
// Displays received packet count, also displays their RSSI and LQI.
